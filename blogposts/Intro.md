# Blogpost 1 – What and Why XR

When I think about XR, I see it as a big umbrella term that covers VR, AR, and MR.  
The differences can quickly get technical, but at its core, it’s about how we blend the digital and the physical.  
- **VR** pulls you fully into a new world.  
- **AR** adds digital layers on top of reality.  
- **MR** tries to merge the two so digital objects feel like they actually belong in the room.  

To me, it makes sense to use **XR** as the overall term, because in practice, the lines between these different realities are becoming more and more blurred.

## XR vs. Traditional Apps

I experience XR as something very different from the apps we normally use on phones or computers.  
A mobile app is about swiping on a flat screen, while XR pulls you into the experience with your whole body.  

That’s a huge advantage in terms of **presence** and **immersion**—but it’s also a drawback, because it often requires expensive hardware and can be a hassle to set up.  

I like the idea that XR can make learning and collaboration more natural, but I also think there’s a barrier before it becomes something everyone can use in their everyday lives.

## What Excites Me About XR

What excites me most about XR are the possibilities it opens up:  

- **Education** – walking through a historical environment instead of just reading about it.  
- **Healthcare** – surgeons practicing difficult operations again and again in VR without risk.  
- **Everyday life** – using AR to see how a sofa fits into your living room before you buy it.

## Looking Ahead

Even though today’s technology still feels a bit clunky, I believe we’re moving toward a point where XR will be much more integrated and effortless.  

I picture a future where we no longer talk about *“screen time”* because the digital world is simply woven into the physical one.  

That can be both fascinating and a little scary—but that’s exactly why it’s important to think about **why XR makes sense**, and how we can use it in ways that actually add value to our lives.
